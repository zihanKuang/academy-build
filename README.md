# 🏫 Update Academy Action

**Trigger an academy content update for your organization using the Layer5 Cloud API.**

This action is useful when you want to build and deploy an academy site (powered by Hugo) and then notify the Layer5 platform to pull the latest content for your organization.

---

## 🚀 Usage

```yaml
- name: Trigger Academy Update
  uses: layer5io/academy-build@v1
  with:
    orgId: 'your-org-id'
    token: ${{ secrets.ACADEMY_API_TOKEN }}
    version: 'v1.2.3' # optional, defaults to "latest"
```

You can integrate this into your workflows after building your site or on versioned releases.

## ✅ Example Workflow

This workflow runs on every release and triggers an academy content update with the release version:

```yaml
name: Update Academy on Release

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  update-academy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

     
      - name: Call Layer5 Academy Update API
        uses: layer5io/academy-build@v0.1.3
        with:
          orgId: 'your-org-id'
          token: ${{ secrets.ACADEMY_API_TOKEN }}
          version: ${{ github.ref_name }}

      - name: Print API response
        run: echo "${{ steps.update.outputs.response }}"
```

## 🔐 Security

Always store the `token` input as a GitHub secret and **never hardcode it** in your workflow YAML.
